        <p>The console is a great tool for learning Javascript, you can read all about it here <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console" target="blank">here</a>.
        It allows us direct access to the javascript event loop so that we may execute statements in real time! This course will rely heavely on the console to test out new techniques and skills; it is expected that students will familiarize themselves with how to use the console (access and execute statements) before the end of the first week of class. There are several ways to access the console. </p>
